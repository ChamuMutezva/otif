# OTIF solution

## The project

The project was created using HTML, css and bootstrap 5. It is my first time creating a project using Bootstrap 5 for styling, hence they should be some improvements that can be done. Having said that the site is responsive and can be viewed on most devices.

The site has 3 pages , the index.html, products.html and the shipping.html page where the landing page is the index.page
- to navigate to the products page , press the `Get started` button in the heading section
- to navigate to the shipping page , press the `Shipping` link button in the footer section

A CSS file was included to override some of the styles mainly the font sizes , and to add pseudo elements and pseudo classes

### todo

- Hide back-to-top button when full view has been reached
- investigate heading elements order for consistence

Start button text is different - figma text is written `explore now`
